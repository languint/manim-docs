title: MObject
description: Manim.MObject
---

MObjects (Mathematical Objects) are the basis of most classes in Manim. They are abstract and cannot be used directly; you must instead define a class inheriting from this class.

## Attributes

You can optionally pass an attributes interface which will add those fields to the constructor.

```ts
import { Manim, ObjectTypes } from "@rbxts/manim"

type MyObjectAttributes = {
    color: Color3;
} & ObjectTypes.MyObjectAttributes

export class MyObject extends Manim.Objects.MObject<MyObjectAttributes> {
    construct(): void {}

    tick(dt: number): void {}

    constructor(params: MyObjectAttributes) {
        super();
        this.params = params;
    }
}

```

## Members

### `params`

:::caution 
This may be undefined. Since Scenes are inherited from MObjects, but they are never *constructed*, this will be undefined. However, in the case of scenes, when decorated with **@Manim.Decorators.Scene()**, the parameters will be set based on the arguments passed in there.
:::

The given parameters, it has the type of T if given, otherwise MyObjectAttributes.

## Methods

### `addChild(name: string, child: MObject)`

Adds a given child to the `__children` member and sets the child's `__parent` to `this`.

**Parameters**:

- `name` - The name of the child that can be used to access it later.
- `child` - The child object to add.

### `getChild<T?>(name: string)`

Retrieves a child with the given name. If given a generic type, the child's params member will be typed with the given Attributes.

### `removeChild(name: string)`

Removes a child from the `__children` parameter of this object, and calls the `delete()` method on the object.

**Parameters**:

- `name` - The name of the child to remove.

### `getOutputInstance()`

Returns the "real instance" to output to, e.g `Workspace`. Defaults to the object's `__parent` if the parent does not exist it returns the Instance's `__outputInstance`.

### `abstract construct()`

This is the entry point of the MObject, this is where all code should be written.

### `abstract tick(dt: number)`

Updates the mobject.

:::tip
Use `Manim.Decorators.Ticker()` to automatically call the `tick()` method on **HeartBeat**.
