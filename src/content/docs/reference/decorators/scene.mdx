This is about the Scene decorator, the [Scene](/manim-docs/reference/objects/scene) class is what your code will inherit from.
</Aside>

The Scene decorator will mark a given class as a [Scene](/manim-docs/reference/objects/scene).

```ts frame=none {4-10}
import { Manim } from "@rbxts/manim";
import { Workspace } from "@rbxts/services";

@Manim.Decorators.Scene(
	{
		name: "MyScene",
		destroyOnCompleted: false,
	},
	Workspace,
)
@Manim.Decorators.Ticker()
export class MyScene extends Manim.SceneWithCamera {
	construct(): void {}

	tick(dt: number): void {
		this.tickAllChildren(dt); // Recursively update all children.
	}
}

Manim.init();
```

In the example above, after calling **init()** the manim Registry takes over and will call `construct()`, and also `tick()` because our scene is marked as so.
